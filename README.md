### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am Lokeswari. I prefer being called Sindhu.Writing good code gives me the same rush and satisfaction as solving a difficult math problem did when I was in 8th grade. 

### Not very on Github because I prefer to spend after work time with my Books, Ukulele or doodling something! ðŸ˜„

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on React native, SwiftUI, UIKit, Everything Swift âœ¨
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything interesting. I am a sucker for good animations. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Swift, React native. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am currently obsessed with drawing through code. It is so much fun.
